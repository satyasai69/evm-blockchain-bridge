# EVM Blockchain bridge simplified

**[You can read the full article for this project in the Chainstack blog](https://chainstack.com/how-to-create-blockchain-bridge/)**

This project contains multiple pieces to create a functional (although **not production ready**) ERC20 blockchain bridge between two EVM-compatible chains.

It uses a wallet as an escrow and leverages the events triggered by the ERC20 tokens to burn and mint tokens on each side of the bridge

## Requirements

- Node.js at least v18.15.0— [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- You'll need access to nodes in different chains to use this bridge. [Check out the Chainstack docs to learn how to deploy nodes](https://docs.chainstack.com/docs/platform-introduction).

## Build & Compile

Create a Metamask wallet and get some tokens for your target networks. This code was tested with Sepolia and BNB testnet. You can get testnet tokens using the [Chainstack Faucet](https://faucet.chainstack.com/sepolia-faucet).

Clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chainstacklabs/evm-blockchain-bridge.git
```

### Deploy smart contracts

```sh
cd solidity
```

Clean install dependencies.

```sh
npm ci
```

Rename `/solidity/.env.example` to `/solidity/.env` and fill in the details with your wallet address and the RPC endpoints from your Chainstack dashboard.

To deploy your contracts, run `npm run deploy:ori` and `npm run deploy:dest`.

You'll get the contract address in the console.

> You can test the contracts running `npm run test`.

### Front-end

Navigate to the `web` directory.

```sh
cd .. && cd web
```

Clean install dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

Rename `/web/.env.example` to `/web/.env` and fill in the details with your wallet address, RPC endpoints, and token addresses from the deployed smart contracts.

To build the front end, run `npm run build` inside the `web` directory. You can run the front end locally with `npm run dev` or deploy the generated `dist` folder to any static site hosting.

### Back-end

The back-end service is required to run the bridge.

Navigate to the `backend` directory.

```sh
cd .. && cd backend
```

Clean install dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

Rename `/backend/.env.example` to `/backend/.env` and fill in the details with your wallet address, RPC endpoints, and token addresses from the deployed smart contracts.

To start the back-end service, run `npm start`.

Once the back-end service runs, you can use the front end to send tokens through the bridge.
